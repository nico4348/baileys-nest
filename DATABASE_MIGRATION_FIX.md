# Database Migration Fix Summary

## Problem

The application was failing to start with the following error:

```
QueryFailedError: la columna «event_id» de la relación «event_logs» contiene valores null
```

This occurred because TypeORM was trying to add a NOT NULL constraint to the `event_id` column, but there were existing records in the `event_logs` table with NULL values in that column.

## Root Cause

The `event_logs` table had 15 records with NULL `event_id` values, which prevented TypeORM from applying the NOT NULL constraint during schema synchronization.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Temporary Schema Modification

- Modified `TypeOrmEventLogsEntity.ts` to make `event_id` column nullable temporarily
- This allowed the application to start and TypeORM to synchronize the schema

### 2. Data Migration

- Created and executed a Node.js migration script that:
  - Connected to the PostgreSQL database using the same credentials as the application
  - Created a default event with name 'default_event' for migration purposes
  - Updated all 15 records with NULL `event_id` values to use the default event ID
  - Verified that no NULL values remained

### 3. Schema Restoration

- Reverted `TypeOrmEventLogsEntity.ts` back to NOT NULL constraint for `event_id`
- Confirmed the application starts successfully with the proper schema

## Migration Details

- **Database**: pruebaNest (PostgreSQL)
- **Default Event Created**: ID `2f8aa93e-b534-4342-b4b2-f40614471dcf`
- **Records Updated**: 15 event_logs records
- **Migration Status**: ✅ Completed Successfully

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/EventLogs/infrastructure/TypeOrm/TypeOrmEventLogsEntity.ts` - Temporarily made event_id nullable, then reverted
2. `migrations/update-event-logs-event-id-column.sql` - Created SQL migration script (for reference)
3. `migration-fix.js` - Temporary Node.js migration script (removed after use)

## Verification

- Application now starts successfully on port 3000
- All TypeORM modules initialize properly
- Database schema synchronization completes without errors
- All API endpoints are properly mapped and available

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always check for existing data before adding NOT NULL constraints
2. Use proper database migrations instead of relying solely on TypeORM synchronization
3. Implement data validation in application layer to prevent NULL values where not allowed
